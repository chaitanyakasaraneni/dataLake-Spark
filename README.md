# Project - Data Lake
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we will build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. We will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. We will deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
- Python 3
- AWS
- Spark

## Data
### Song Dataset
- Subset of data from [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/)
- JSON files in S3 contain metadata about songs and artists
- Link: `s3://udacity-dend-spark-project/song_data`

### Log Dataset
- JSON log files generated by [eventsim](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on above dataset
- Link: `s3://udacity-dend-spark-project/log_data`

## Files in Repository

- `etl.py` - reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3

- `dl.cfg` - AWS credentials (fill accordantly)

- **data** - contains smaller datasets for testing purposes

## ETL Pipeline
    
1.  Read data from S3
    
    -   Song data:  `s3://udacity-dend-spark-project/song_data`
    -   Log data:  `s3://udacity-dend-spark-project/log_data`
    
    The script reads song_data and load_data from S3.
    
3.  Process data using spark
    
    Transforms them to create five different tables listed below : 
    #### Fact Table
	 **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

	#### Dimension Tables
	 **users**  - users in the app
		Fields -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
		
	 **songs**  - songs in music database
    Fields - _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
    
	**artists**  - artists in music database
    Fields -   _artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude_
    
	  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    Fields -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_
    
4.  Load it back to S3
    
    Writes them to partitioned parquet files in table directories on S3.

## Deployement
If you are using local as your development environemnt - Moving project directory from local to EMR 

     scp -i <.pem-file> <Local-Path> <username>@<EMR-MasterNode-Endpoint>:~<EMR-path>

Running spark job (Before running job make sure EMR Role have access to s3)

    spark-submit etl.py --master yarn --deploy-mode client --driver-memory 4g --num-executors 2 --executor-memory 2g --executor-core 2

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

> Add IAM role info to `dl.cfg`

> Reminder: Delete your cluster when finished (if applicable)
